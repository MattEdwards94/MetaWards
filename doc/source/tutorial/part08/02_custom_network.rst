Creating a Custom Network
=========================

While the default networks supplied in ``MetaWardsData`` model the UK, there
is nothing to stop you creating your own network to model any country or
region. Indeed, you can use the concepts of ``wards``, ``workers`` and
``players`` in a more generic way to model lots of different environments,
e.g.

* Using wards to represent different university buildings, and then track
  disease spread between buildings as staff and students move around.
* Using wards to represent care homes, hospitals and homes in a single
  region, and then model the motion of staff, patients and the general
  population between these different environments.
