  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --version             Print the version information about metawards
    -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                          Input file for the simulation that specifies the
                          adjustable parameters to change for each run of the
                          model. You must supply some input to run a model!
    -l [LINE [LINE ...]], --line [LINE [LINE ...]]
                          Line number (or line numbers) containing the values of
                          adjustable parameters to run for this run (or runs) of
                          the model If this isn't specified then model runs will
                          be performed for adjustable parameters given on all
                          lines from the input file. You can specify many
                          numbers, and ranges are also accepted, e.g. '-l 5 6-10
                          12,13,14' etc. Note that the line numbers are
                          0-indexed, e.g. the first line of the file is line 0.
                          Ranges are inclusive, so 3-5 is the same as 3 4 5
    -r REPEATS, --repeats REPEATS
                          The number of repeat runs of the model to perform for
                          each value of the adjustable parameters. By default
                          only a single run will be performed for each set of
                          adjustable parameters
    -s SEED, --seed SEED  Random number seed for this run (default is to use a
                          random seed)
    -a [ADDITIONAL [ADDITIONAL ...]], --additional [ADDITIONAL [ADDITIONAL ...]]
                          File (or files) containing additional seed of outbreak
                          for the model. These are used to seed additional
                          infections on specific days at different locations
                          during a model run
    -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                          Path to the directory in which to place all output
                          files (default 'output'). This directory will be
                          subdivided if multiple adjustable parameter sets or
                          repeats are used.
    -u UV, --UV UV        Value for the UV parameter for the model (default is
                          1.0)
    -d DISEASE, --disease DISEASE
                          Name of the disease to model (default is 'ncov')
    -I INPUT_DATA, --input-data INPUT_DATA
                          Name of the input data set for the network (default is
                          '2011Data')
    --start-date START_DATE
                          Date of the start of the model outbreak. This accepts
                          dates either is iso-format, or fuzzy dates such as
                          'monday', 'tomorrow' etc. This is used to work out
                          which days are weekends, or to make it easier to
                          specify time-based events.
    --start-day START_DAY
                          The start day of the model outbreak. By default the
                          model outbreak starts on day zero (0), with each step
                          of the model representing an additional day. Use this
                          to start from a later day, which may be useful if you
                          want to more quickly reach time based events. Note
                          that the passed '--start-date' is always day 0, so day
                          10 has a date which is 10 days after start-date
    -p PARAMETERS, --parameters PARAMETERS
                          Name of the input parameter set used to control the
                          simulation (default 'march29')
    -R REPOSITORY, --repository REPOSITORY
                          Path to the MetaWardsData repository. If unspecified
                          this defaults to the value in the environment variable
                          METAWARDSDATA or, if that isn't specified, to
                          $HOME/GitHub/MetaWardsData
    -P POPULATION, --population POPULATION
                          Initial population (default 57104043)
    -n NSTEPS, --nsteps NSTEPS
                          Maximum number of steps (days) to run for the
                          simulation. Each step represents one day in the
                          outbreak (default is to run until the outbreak has
                          finished).
    --nthreads NTHREADS   Number of threads over which parallelise an individual
                          model run. The total number of cores used by metawards
                          will be nprocesses x nthreads
    --nprocs NPROCS       The number of processes over which to parallelise the
                          different model runs for different adjustable
                          parameter sets and repeats. By default this will
                          automatically work out the number of processes based
                          on the way metawards is launched. Use this option if
                          you want to specify the number of processes manually.
    --hostfile HOSTFILE   The hostfile containing the names of the compute nodes
                          over which to run a parallel job. If this is not set,
                          the program will attempt to automatically get this
                          information from the cluster queueing system. Use this
                          if the auto-detection fails
    --cores-per-node CORES_PER_NODE
                          Set the number of processor cores available on each of
                          the compute nodes in the cluster that will be used to
                          run the models (if a cluster is used). If this is not
                          set then the program will attempt to get this
                          information from the cluster queueing system. Use this
                          option if the auto-detection fails.
    --auto-bzip           Automatically bz2 compress all output files as they
                          are written.
    --no-auto-bzip        Do not automatically bz2 compress all output files as
                          they are written.
    --force-overwrite-output
                          Whether or not to force overwriting of any existing
                          output. Using this option will tell metawards that it
                          is safe to delete the contents of the output directory
                          specified in by '--output' if it already exists.
                          Dangerous as this can remove existing output files
    --profile             Enable profiling of the code
    --no-profile          Disable profiling of the code
    --mpi                 Force use of MPI to parallelise across runs
    --scoop               Force use of scoop to parallelise across runs
